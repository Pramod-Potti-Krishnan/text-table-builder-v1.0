# üîí Text Service Security Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Code Updated - Ready for Railway Deployment
**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

The Text & Table Builder service on Railway was using a **compromised Google API key** that had been exposed and was being exploited by hackers. Even though you disabled billing and deleted the API key from the GCP Console, **the service continued working** because Railway had the compromised key stored in its environment variables.

**The security fix has been implemented** in code and is ready for deployment to Railway.

---

## What Was Done (Completed)

### ‚úÖ Code Security Updates

All code changes have been completed and are ready for deployment:

#### 1. **Updated `app/core/llm_client.py`** (app/core/llm_client.py:99-213)

**Before (INSECURE)**:
```python
# Used compromised API key
self.api_key = api_key or os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
genai.configure(api_key=self.api_key)
```

**After (SECURE)**:
```python
# Uses Vertex AI with service account authentication
service_account_json = os.getenv("GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON")
project_id = os.getenv("GCP_PROJECT_ID")
vertexai.init(project=project_id, location=location, credentials=credentials)
```

**Changes**:
- Replaced `google-generativeai` SDK with `vertexai` SDK
- Removed API key authentication entirely
- Implemented service account JSON credential authentication
- Added support for both Railway (service account) and local (ADC) development
- Updated provider name from "gemini" to "gemini-vertex"

#### 2. **Updated `requirements.txt`** (requirements.txt:11)

**Added**:
```
google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.70.0  # Vertex AI for Gemini (primary, secure)
```

**Kept for compatibility**:
```
google-generativeai>=0.3.0,<1.0.0  # Legacy SDK (no longer used for auth)
```

#### 3. **Created Documentation**

- `SECURITY_UPDATE_VERTEX_AI.md` - Detailed technical specifications
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions
- `SECURITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## What You Need to Do Next (Action Required)

### üö® STEP 1: Update Railway Environment Variables (URGENT)

You must access the Railway dashboard and make these changes:

#### Access Railway:
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find: **web-production-e3796** (Text & Table Builder)
3. Click: **Variables** tab

#### DELETE this variable:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY  ‚Üê DELETE IMMEDIATELY
```

#### ADD these three variables:
```bash
GCP_PROJECT_ID=deckster-xyz
GCP_LOCATION=us-central1
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=<paste your full service account JSON here>
```

**How to get the service account JSON**:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Navigate to: IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts
3. Select your service account
4. Actions (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí Manage Keys ‚Üí Add Key ‚Üí Create New Key ‚Üí JSON
5. Download the JSON file
6. Copy the ENTIRE contents and paste into Railway

### üöÄ STEP 2: Deploy to Railway

Once Railway environment variables are updated, deploy the code:

```bash
# Navigate to Text Service directory
cd /Users/pk1980/Documents/Software/deckster-backend/deckster-w-content-strategist/agents/text_table_builder/v1.0

# Stage the security fixes
git add app/core/llm_client.py requirements.txt *.md

# Commit with security message
git commit -m "üö® SECURITY: Migrate from API key to Vertex AI service account auth

- Replace API key authentication with Vertex AI service account
- Add google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.70.0 dependency
- Remove dependency on compromised GOOGLE_API_KEY
- Fixes security vulnerability with compromised API key"

# Push to trigger Railway deployment
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically rebuild and redeploy with the new secure code.

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: Verify Deployment

After deployment completes:

#### Test Health Endpoint:
```bash
curl https://web-production-e3796.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

#### Test Text Generation:
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-e3796.up.railway.app/api/v1/generate/text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topics": ["security test"],
    "narrative": "Testing Vertex AI authentication",
    "constraints": {"word_count": 50},
    "presentation_id": "test-001"
  }'
```

Expected: Generated text content (not authentication error)

#### Test Director Agent Stage 6:
```bash
cd /Users/pk1980/Documents/Software/deckster-backend/deckster-w-content-strategist/agents/director_agent/v3.3
python3 tests/test_director_standalone.py --scenario default
```

Expected: All 6 stages pass including Stage 6 (Content Generation)

## Security Impact

### Before This Fix:
- ‚ùå Text Service using **compromised API key**: `AIzaSyAG2ruDJBZfFphdHZurk3X6vsXpmOkaH_c`
- ‚ùå Vulnerable to **unauthorized access**
- ‚ùå Risk of **billing fraud** from hackers
- ‚ùå API key **exposed in environment variables**

### After This Fix:
- ‚úÖ **Service account authentication** (no API keys)
- ‚úÖ **Least-privilege access** via GCP IAM
- ‚úÖ **Credentials rotation** possible without code changes
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced security** with Application Default Credentials
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail** via GCP service account logs

## Environment Variables

### Old Configuration (INSECURE - Remove):
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAG2ruDJBZfFphdHZurk3X6vsXpmOkaH_c  # ‚Üê COMPROMISED
```

### New Configuration (SECURE - Add):
```bash
GCP_PROJECT_ID=deckster-xyz                    # Your GCP project
GCP_LOCATION=us-central1                       # GCP region
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account",...}  # Full JSON
```

---

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow

#### Railway Production:
```
Text Service ‚Üí Reads GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON from env
           ‚Üí Parses JSON to create credentials
           ‚Üí Initializes Vertex AI with service account
           ‚Üí Generates content via Vertex AI API
```

#### Local Development:
```
Text Service ‚Üí Checks for GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON (not found)
           ‚Üí Falls back to Application Default Credentials (ADC)
           ‚Üí Initializes Vertex AI with ADC
           ‚Üí Generates content via Vertex AI API
```

### Dependencies

**New Primary**:
- `google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.70.0` - Vertex AI SDK

**Legacy (kept for compatibility)**:
- `google-generativeai>=0.3.0` - Old Gemini SDK (not used for auth)
